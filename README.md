        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <p>Download this batch <a href="https://github.com/zahitmy/crowdstrike-fix/releases/tag/Download">script</a>.</p>
        <p>Run the Script: Double-click the <b>FIX_crowdstrike.bat</b> file to run it on a Windows system.</p>
     <h2>Usage:</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1 and Step 4:</strong> These steps are marked as manual because they require actions that cannot be easily automated from within a batch script.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will be prompted to enter the path to the CrowdStrike directory (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike). Ensure you provide the correct path.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The script will prompt you before deleting files matching C-00000291*.sys in the specified CrowdStrike directory. Confirm deletion by typing Y and pressing Enter.</p>
      <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Deleting system files can potentially render your Windows system unusable. Ensure you have appropriate backups and understand the implications of deleting files before proceeding.</p>
        <p><strong>Manual Steps:</strong> The script assumes you will manually handle steps that require interaction with the Windows environment, such as booting into Safe Mode or confirming file deletions.</p>
        <p><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Modify the script according to your specific environment and security requirements.</p>
